# Results from The Odin Project

## Introduction

This repo contains various projects completed while going through
[The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). Thought I have roughly 8 months
of experience developing front-end applications using Svelte[Kit], all of
that experience was on-the-job learning. I chose to tackle this course in
an attempt to master Full-Stack development using JavaScript.

## Skills

Below are some skills I already feel very comfortable with:

  * Git
  * JavaScript
  * Python (for API development with FastAPI)

Throughout this course, I hope to develop a mastery of the following:

  * JavaScript
  * React
